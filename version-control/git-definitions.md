# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the use of multiple branches (apart from the master branch) in a repository that allows multiple people to work on the same project without making changes to the master branch. This creates organization within a group or team and prevents changes from appear in your block of code without context, description, or reason. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a step in the Git workflow in which a copy of the master branch is created and renamed in order to input changes to a project without updating the master branch. You would use one to keep organization while making changes to a block of code or a project so as to input those changes in a clearer and more consise manner.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for the changes made to a file in a repository. These changes are always accompanied by a commit message that describes the changes made. A good commit message is clear and consise representation of the changes made. It should be 50 characters or less and should be written in the imperative as if given a command. The beginning of a commit message should always be capitalized. 

* What is a merge conflict?

Occur when the merge process of one branch into another does not occur smoothly.  If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you're merging together, Git won't be able to merge them cleanly and you will receive an error message.
