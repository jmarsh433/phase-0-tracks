JQUERY TACKLE PLAN

One of the most effective resources for me when discovering and understanding a new topic is to research it on Youtube. There are many channels available (especially on the topic of web development)
that have some great overviews of the application and understanding of jquery. 

In addition to using youtube video tutorials I also will research the topic on reddit.  And as I suspected there is an entire subreddit dedicated to JQUERY.  These include various user errors, warnings, etc.  These are great because many of the issues people encounter on JQUERY  are universal and could affect me in the future.  Reading through these subreddit posts could share some insight on some common problems users have with JQUERY.
