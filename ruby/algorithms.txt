#Elevator Algorithm
Robot take note of current_floor_level
Puts "Do you want to go up or down"
	answer = gets.chomp
If "up"
	press up_arrow
Else
	press down_arrow

When doors open, enter the elevator.
If answer = "up"
	choose desire_floor > current_floor_level
Else 
	choose desired_floor < current_floor_level
Press door_close button

Elevator will proceed to desired_floor
When doors open proceed out of elevator at destination



#Guitar Tuner Algorithm
tune_by_ear

Tuning E String
Play Low_E_string (6th string or thickest)
	Play a reference_E_note
		If Low_E_string is sharp (higher than reference note)
			Twist tuner to loosen Low_E_string until Low_E_string and reference note are in harmony
		If E_string is flat (lower than reference note)
			Twist tuner to tighten E sring until Low_E_string and reference note are in harmony
	Low_E_string is now in tune
Now that there is one string in Tune we can tune all others to that reference Low_E_string

Tuning A String
Place finger on the 5th_fret of the Low_E_string -- This is the A note
the next string down (A_string) is the same note when played open.
Strike the 5th_fret Low_E_String and stike the open A_string
	if the open A is sharp (higher than the Low E)
		Twist tuner to loosen A_String until it is at Low_E pitch (harmony)
	Else
		the open A is flat (lower than the low E)
		Twist tuner to tighten A_string until it is a Low_E pitch (harmony)

Tuning D String
Place finger on 5th fret of A string (the is the D note)
Play Open D string then play 5th fret A string
	if open D string is flat, 
		twist tuner to tighten string until in harmony with 5th fret A
	else
		open D string is sharp, twist tuner to loosen string until in harmony with 5th fret A


Tuning G String
Place finger on 5th fret of D string (this is the D note)
play Open G string then play 5th fret D string
	if open G string is flat
		twist tuner to tighten string until 5th fret D and open G are in harmony
	else 
		open G is sharp - twist string to loosen until 5th fret D and open G are in harmony


Tuning B STring
Place finger on 4th fret of G string (this is a B note)
play open B then play 4th fret G string
	if open B is flat
		twist tuner to tighten string until 4th fret G and open B are in harmony
	else
		open B is sharp - twist B string to loosen until 4th fret G and Open b are in harmony

Tuing High e String
Place finger on 5th fret of B string (this is an E note)
Play open High e then play 5th fret B string
	if open High e is flat
		twist tuner to tighten string until 5th fret B string and open high e string are in harmony
	else
		open high e string is sharp -- twist high e string to loosen until 5th fret B and open high e are in harmony
