<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  HTML5 semantic tags are useful for organizing your code in a clear and readable format not only for yourself but for other's who you collaborate with. So far, the most useful tags are <h></h> for headers, <a href=""></a> for links, <p></p> for paragraph text, and using lists (ul, ol, li). 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  When working only in html, not with css, the browser reads your code in order. For instance, in the code above, if I put the <nav></nav> feature below the table and refreshed the browser, it would appear there. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  I did not know that the html[TAB] was a snippet! I thought it was so common that they just added it -- which is true, but creating code snippets will help me down the line when I want to reuse certain elements (but with different content) throughout my site, across however many pages.
